# Varsity Code
## Developing Tomorrows Technical Leaders Today
## Turning Curisoity into Technical Talent
## Technical Leadership Starts Here

## Six Week Minecraft Code Club
Channel your passion for Minecraft into a cash course in
hardware and software development. 

 - Learn to code by builing incredible Minecraft structures
 - Build your very own micro computer
 - Learn to collaborate and develop with other coders and start building
   your code resume.
 - Learn Linux, the open source operating system that powers the
   majority of the internet.

### Learn to Code with Minecraft
##### Write Algorthims to Build Awesomeness

What better way to learn the fundamentals of coding than by automating
the wide world of Minecraft? Learn how to automatically build towering
structures and complex landscapes with your very own code. Share your
programs with your friends and build vast cities together as a club.

### Raspberry Pi Microcomputers
##### Build and develop on your very own micro computer.

The Raspberry Pi is a small credit card sized micro computer that runs a
flavor of Linux, and is the perfect platform to learn how to code. You
will be guided through installing Linux, setting up your coding
environment, and installing a special Raspberry Pi edition of Minecraft.
Best of all, this Raspberry Pi is yours to take home and work on your
own time.

### Build Your Code Resume
##### A Long Road of Coding Experience Starts Here

All of your work will be stored on GitHub, the network to share and
develop code. Many employers wont even look at resumes anymore, they'll
just ask to see your GitHub profile so they can see your code. Showing
off your work on GitHub is prefect place to start building your code
resume.

### Linux - The Backbone of the Internet
##### Emerse yourself in the Open Source EcoSystem

We will learn and code on the Linux operating system. Linux powers the
majority of web severs today and is completley open source, meaning the
code is accesible and open to everyone to read and modify. Learning
Linux will you prepare you to manage servers of your own and will open a
world of open source development tools that software industry uses every
day.

## Class Format and Schedule
6 Saturday Coding Sessions, from 9am-12pm.

- 9am - 10am - Lecture
- 10am - 11am - Lab Work with Lab Partner
- 11am - 12pm - Free Development Time / 1-on-1 QA

### Lab Work
Software development is about collaboration and communication. During
the hands on lab sections, we pair you up with one of your classmates
and you will 'Pair Program', where you work through the lab work
together. The best way to understand something is to be able to teach
it. Teaching and working with each other in lab will be key in your
foundational coding eduction.

### Free Development Time
This is your time to be creative and explore on your own the concepts we
learned during lecture and lab. Our instructors will also take the time
to review your work and talk to you about your progress.

## Small Class Sizes
Coding can be tricky, we've found the fastest way to learn is to talk
through the subjects one on one.

With class sizes of no bigger than 10, we'll make sure you get all the 
help you need.
